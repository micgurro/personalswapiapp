# About This Exercise


The goal of this exercise is to give us an idea of how I solve front-end engineering problems.

- My ability to write idiomatic JavaScript.
- My approach to breaking down user interfaces into components.
- My comfort level with making API requests and working with responses.

## User Stories

Build a single page React application using the provided skeleton which allows a user to:

- [x] List all StarWars films showing **title** and **release date** and link
    to list all characters in the film
- [x] Each item in the characters list should link to a character profile
- [x] Arrange the available character info, employing basic rules of
  - information hierachy
  - contrast
  - typography
  - color

For data, you can use the [SWAPI REST API](https://swapi.co/documentation) or
bonus points for using the new [SWAPI GraphQL
API](http://graphql.org/swapi-graphql/) and
[Apollo](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/).

Check out [the setup instructions](setup.md) for a guide to getting started
with this project scaffold.

## Installation

To install this application locate and change to the project directory.

Use 'npx install' (npm install for node versions lower than 5.3) and 'npm start' to get the development page running.

Located in the project directory will be the swapi-graphql sub-module. Open this directory, install with node, and start the development server. Once the local server is up and running open 'index.js' and change the URI's port to the one provided by the development server.

If the swapi-graphql sub-module is not provided it can be cloned from the following repo: https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql.git

http://localhost:3000 should return the app.
